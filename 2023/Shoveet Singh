Hello everyone, my name is Shoveet and I'm a second-year engineering student from India, West Bengal Calcutta. I am excited to join this community! I am a amature web developer 
with experience in Node.js,React.js(including react naive),mongoDB,Express.js,HTML,CSS.  I am interested in contributing to Wagtail and learning more about its technologies and functionalities.

I am eager to use my skills to make meaningful contributions to the project and work with the team to improve its features and functionalities. This will be my 
first open-source contribution and I am looking forward to learning from the community and contributing to the growth of the project.I hope that my skills would be upgraded if given a chance to contribute towards open source.

I am open to any suggestions on how I can get started and learn more about Wagtail's technologies. I am excited to collaborate and contribute to this project.
